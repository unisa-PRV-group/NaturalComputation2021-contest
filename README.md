# Problem Description
The aim of the project is to learn, or otherwise design, a controller which could be able to race for a certain number of laps on a set of unknown tracks against other controllers. In particular, the primary goal for the project is to design a controller that runs the circuits in the shortest possible time without causing damage and arriving at the first places.</br>

It is necessary to use the APIs and the [Snakeoil Controller](http://xed.ch/p/snakeoil/) to develop a solution. And also it is necessary to use [TORCS](http://torcs.sourceforge.net/): The Open Racing Car Simulator TORCS has often used as a platform for the development and improvement of intelligent agents for autonomous driving in a competitive environment. Moreover, is important to choose an algorithm from those studied during the course and to define the fitness function taking into account the performance of the controller.</br>
The constraints are:
* the number of laps should be at least 2;
* the number of opponents in a race should be at least 8 and should include: *damned 1*, *damned 3*, *damned 4*, *damned 5*, *damned 6*, *berniw hist 2*, *berniw hist 6*, *berniw hist 7*;
* the number of circuits where to train your controller should be at least 2 among *Forza*, *CGTrack-2*, *E-Track-3*, *Wheel-1*.
